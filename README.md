This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is gonna be the first in my series of bootstrap projects to learn and compare libraries/frameworks

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### Local dev server with `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Run tests with `npm run test`

Launches the test runner. 
Use `npm run test:watch` to run tests in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### Build for production Awith `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

### Deployment with `npm run deploy`

Currently using `gh-pages` package to build and deploy to project's GitHub Pages.

Additionally, there's a GitHub Action workfow to build and deploy to GitHub Pages automatically when pushing to 'develop' branch in `.github/main.workfow`
